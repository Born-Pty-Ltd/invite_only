The Invite Only Platform makes access-control easy and accessible to everyone. This is the root folder for all the subsystems
comprising the Invite Only Platform - these include:
* [The Invite Only Core API](invite_only_core/README.md)
* [The Invite Only Dart Repo](invite_only_repo/README.md)
* [The Invite Only App](invite_only_app/README.md)

Furthermore the following were also developed as part of the Invite Only project but have been published as independent
packages so are in separate repositories:
* [The rsa_identification package](https://github.com/Born-Pty-Ltd/rsa_identification)
* [The rsa_scan package](https://github.com/Born-Pty-Ltd/rsa_scan)
